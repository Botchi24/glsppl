## Project Steps & Timeline (Estimated)

1.  **Background & Related Work (Weeks 1-3)**
    - *Tasks:* Literature review on SPLs, variability modeling, GLSP, graph editors. Identify existing approaches.
    - *Deliverable:* Literature Review Summary.
2.  **Domain Analysis (Weeks 4-6)**
    - *Tasks:* Analyze requirements for different potential graph editors. Identify commonalities and variabilities.
    - *Deliverable:* Domain Analysis Report, Initial list of features.
3.  **Feature & Variability Modeling (Weeks 7-9)**
    - *Tasks:* Develop the feature model. Refine variability points. Select implementation mechanisms.
    - *Deliverable:* Feature Model Document, Variability Design Document.
4.  **Architecture Design (Weeks 10-12)**
    - *Tasks:* Design the reference architecture for the SPL. Refine viewpoint models for variability.
    - *Deliverable:* Architecture Design Document.
5.  **Core Asset Implementation (Weeks 13-18)**
    - *Tasks:* Implement the common framework components and variability mechanisms based on the design.
    - *Deliverable:* Core Asset Codebase (prototype).
6.  **Product Derivation Implementation (Weeks 19-21)**
    - *Tasks:* Implement the tools or processes needed to derive specific products from the core assets based on feature selections.
    - *Deliverable:* Product Derivation Mechanism/Tooling.
7.  **Evaluation (Weeks 22-24)**
    - *Tasks:* Derive 1-2 sample editor products. Evaluate the SPL approach based on defined goals (e.g., effort reduction, configurability).
    - *Deliverable:* Evaluation Report, Sample Derived Products.
8.  **Documentation & Thesis Writing (Ongoing, intensified Weeks 25+)**
    - *Tasks:* Document the process, design, and findings. Write the final report/thesis.
    - *Deliverable:* Final Project Report / Thesis.
