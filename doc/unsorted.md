**Technology:**
- Graphical Language Server Platform (GLSP)
- Feature Modeling Tools (FeatureIDE)
- Viewpoint Modeling Techniques
- Relevant programming languages/frameworks (TypeScript, Java, Eclipse Theia/VS Code extensions)

**Cross-Platform Support**

GLSP supports multiple integration contexts, including standalone deployments, Eclipse Theia integration, Eclipse integration, and VS Code integration
. This cross-platform capability could facilitate the development of SPLs that target multiple environments while maintaining a consistent core architecture.

**Rich Feature Set**

GLSP offers comprehensive capabilities that would benefit variability-rich graphical editors, including model saving, export, layout, edit modes, element selection, validation, creation, deletion, clipboard operations, and undo/redo functionality
. These features provide the necessary building blocks for developing graph editors with variable capabilities based on feature selections.
