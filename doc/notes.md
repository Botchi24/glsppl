**Industrial Applications of Feature Modeling**

| Industry	| Key Application Areas/Benefits |
| --- | --- |
| Automotive	| Managing software features, customization, reducing development costs, handling variants |
| Mobile Communication	| Defining features and configurations of mobile devices, managing product diversity |
| E-commerce Systems	| Supporting diverse functionalities, managing customer needs, designing flexible platforms |
| Embedded Systems	| Handling a wide range of configurations and target platforms, managing system complexity |
| Aerospace	| Managing complex system designs, supporting trade-off analysis, reducing risk of failure |
| Telecommunications	| Automating product development, managing variability and commonality among services |
| Cloud Computing	| Configuring resources, managing multiplicity of features, supporting pay-as-you-go models |
| Cyber-Physical Systems	| Modeling variability in complex, evolving systems, managing configurations at runtime |
